# Halo 1 MCC custom maps

This branch adds an independent loader for modern Halo 1 MCC version-13
caches and **MCC SINGLEPLAYER** / **MCC MULTIPLAYER** choices in the map
menus. It is an experimental
runtime adapter, with explicit format limits below. A successful menu
probe or file audit is not proof that a map plays correctly.

## Installation and menus

Put the map in the game data root's `mcc_maps` directory, beside `maps` and
`custom_maps`. For example:

```text
maps/                 Xbox game data
custom_maps/          Halo Custom Edition data
mcc_maps/a10.map       Halo 1 MCC custom map
mcc_maps/a10.txt       Optional plain-text description
mcc_maps/sounds.map    Matching MCC resources, when required by the package
mcc_maps/bitmaps.map   Matching MCC resources, when required by the package
```

The level identity is `mcc_maps\a10`. The filename is retained even when
the internal scenario name differs. The supplied Mercury Rising file is
an example: its filename is `a10.map`, while its header names
`mercury_falling`. The namespaces prevent it replacing either Xbox `a10`
or Custom Edition `custom_maps\a10`.

Some campaigns, including the supplied Combat Revolved package, keep their
audio and textures in separate resource files. Install the matching files
in `mcc_maps` alongside the levels. A filename alone does not establish a
match: the loader verifies each resource's indexed name and byte range.
It never searches `maps` or `custom_maps` for replacements. Packages that
require different resource files must use separate game-data installations.

Open the map-kind chooser and select **MCC SINGLEPLAYER** for campaign
maps or **MCC MULTIPLAYER** for multiplayer maps. The cache header's scenario
type determines the category, independently of the filename; both lists
read the same `mcc_maps` folder. New Game's campaign maps proceed to difficulty
selection, and multiplayer maps can be explored alone. The network host
map screen routes campaign maps to cooperative setup and multiplayer maps
to gametypes. Split-screen multiplayer skips **MCC SINGLEPLAYER**, just as
it skips the existing singleplayer categories. These
are menu routes in the implementation; multiplayer interoperability and
complete campaigns require gameplay testing.
Each selected MCC campaign map is treated as an independent scenario.
Automatic progression through a package's campaign map sequence is not
implemented; the MCC package manifest is not interpreted.

MCC checkpoints retain the canonical `mcc_maps\<filename>` scenario
identity, including when the original tag names an Xbox campaign level.
Continue and Load Game have MCC-specific routes with separate saved-name
storage; they do not turn an MCC checkpoint into a stock campaign level.

The catalog scans only `mcc_maps`, reads each candidate's 2,048-byte header,
and refreshes when a map menu opens. It accepts at most 1,024 entries, with
filenames of at most 54 characters before `.map`. A description is optional;
the default identifies the scenario type. MCC thumbnail sidecars, Workshop
downloads and MCC package manifests are not implemented. There is no
dependency on the Custom Edition setting or its resource directories.

The loader opens source maps read-only. A rejected map reports the failing
stage in `debug.txt` and returns a menu error. Matching the header checksum
can detect that a network host selected a different map version; it is not
a recomputation or authentication of the map's contents. Network support
uses GulchCE's game protocol, not the MCC game client or its matchmaking.

### In-game pause menus

MCC maps use a generated, stock-style pause menu for campaign, cooperative
and multiplayer games. The full, half and quarter viewport layouts follow
the local player arrangement. They use separate MCC-owned widgets, strings,
panels and selection highlights; the default pause route does not open the
map's embedded pause or Settings widgets. Loaded font tags are referenced
without changing their contents.

| Context | Available actions |
| --- | --- |
| Local campaign | Resume Game, Revert to Saved, Restart Level, Save and Quit. |
| Cooperative host | Resume Game, Revert to Saved, Restart Level, Leave Game. |
| Cooperative client | Resume and Leave Game. |
| Local multiplayer | Resume, Restart Game and Leave Game. |
| Multiplayer host | Resume, Restart Game, End Game and Leave Game; Choose Team in team games. |
| Multiplayer client | Resume and Leave Game; Choose Team in team games. |

Multiplayer additionally offers **Settings** when `display.menus=pc` and
there is one local player. It opens the trusted native player Settings
screen for the initiating controller. Split-screen players use Settings
from the main menu, since the native editor needs a full viewport.
Campaign and cooperative pause menus do not offer Settings. Restart,
revert and leaving/end-game actions use confirmation
dialogs with Cancel selected initially. B returns from a confirmation to
the pause screen; Start closes the current player's menu and its navigation
history. At the main pause screen, either resumes play. Resume and team
selection also close only the initiating player's menu, preserving other
local players' screens. Each pause layout uses the native A/B button-icon
tokens in its footer, drawing the map's HUD button glyphs beside Select/Back.
Only local campaign pauses
the simulation; network games continue while a menu is open.

Save and Quit preserves the last valid local campaign checkpoint. Revert
requires a valid checkpoint, and cooperative restart/revert remain
host-controlled. A network restart retains the selected map, variant,
options and players through the native lobby/countdown route. End Game is
host-only and ends the round. Team changes remain subject to authenticated
player identity, host authority and balance checks.

The MCC Settings route uses the initiating controller's profile and widget
history. It does not replace another active profile editor. Its ownership
ends on native Save/Cancel, menu closure, replacement editing or map unload,
so a later native editor cannot be closed by stale MCC state.

Campaign layouts display the scenario's current mission objectives through
the native objective-text callback. Owned objective and confirmation text
boxes wrap their instance copies using the current font's metrics and clip
to their bounds. The map's objective data, custom HUD
and embedded widgets remain present. Scripts that explicitly open embedded
widgets can still use the MCC callback adapter described below. The new
pause labels and confirmation text are currently English; localization of
these generated strings is not implemented.

## Repository architecture and isolation

GulchCE is authoritative for this work. `source/` contains the reconstructed
Xbox game systems, including scenario/tag access, cache I/O, the script
interpreter, rendering, audio, objects, game variants and UI. The native
platform layers under `port/linux/`, `port/windows/` and `port/android/`
provide the host services used by those systems. The desktop renderer
implements the game's Xbox interfaces using the existing native graphics
backend. Menu XML and generated settings define the native map chooser.
The `tools/` tests and native harnesses exercise both portable utilities and
selected game subsystems.

Existing Custom Edition support has its own catalog, cache reader,
conversion, resource and behavior modules. Those modules and their state
are not an MCC implementation dependency. The independent components are:

| Component | Responsibility |
| --- | --- |
| `port/linux/game/mcc_maps.c` | Catalog, display identities, names and descriptions. |
| `port/linux/game/mcc_cache_format.c` | Portable little-endian version-13 reader and file-range audit. |
| `port/linux/game/mcc_cache.c` | MCC path admission, read-only file lifetime, conversion and streaming dispatch. |
| `port/linux/game/mcc_main.c` | MCC load-failure recovery through the native main-menu lifecycle. |
| `port/linux/game/mcc_ui.c` and `mcc_ui_network.inl` | MCC in-map widget actions, settings routing, checkpoint/quit behavior and synchronized network restarts. |
| `port/linux/game/mcc_pause.c` and `mcc_pause_runtime.c` | Generated stock-style pause layouts, objective display, independent UI art and atomic publication/lifetime of the appended tags. |
| `port/linux/game/mcc_ui_teams.c` | Authenticated team-only requests during MCC multiplayer rounds, with host balance checks and normal respawn replication. |
| `port/linux/src/mcc_memory.c` | Separate 64 MiB linked tag window; never replaces an existing allocation. |
| `port/linux/game/mcc_geometry.c` | New model descriptors, model vertex/index conversion, external BSP vertex streams and node palettes. |
| `port/linux/game/mcc_audio.c` | MCC sound decoding, resampling and Xbox ADPCM encoding into an MCC virtual stream. |
| `port/linux/game/mcc_resources.c` | MCC-only indexed sound/bitmap resource files, names, ranges and file lifetime. |
| `port/linux/game/mcc_vorbis.c` | Private namespaced Vorbis decoder, bounded Ogg validation and empty residue vector compatibility. |
| `port/linux/game/mcc_bitmaps.c` | MCC pixel layout, BC7 decoding and shader/HUD channel normalization into an MCC virtual stream. |
| `port/linux/game/mcc_texture_cache.c` and `port/linux/src/mcc_texture_bridge.c` | Direct bindings of checked MCC pixel allocations and lazy GPU textures, independent of the Xbox/CE staging cache. |
| `port/linux/game/mcc_tags.c` | MCC metadata, shader-type, HUD placement and widget normalization. |
| `port/linux/game/mcc_hud.c` | MCC bitmap/placement scaling, including nested weapon and grenade HUD items. |
| `port/linux/game/mcc_hud_draw.c` | MCC canvas, glyph geometry and text advances; neutral dispatch for Xbox/CE. |
| `port/linux/game/mcc_scripts.c` | Name-based MCC function/global linking and supported MCC native functions. |
| `port/linux/game/mcc_campaign.c` | Local-player/authority queries, gravity, campaign markers and scoped global permissions. |
| `port/linux/game/mcc_syntax.c` | MCC's 32,767-slot syntax validation and traversal workspace. |
| `port/linux/game/mcc_script_parameters.c` and `mcc_script_runtime.inl` | MCC parameter metadata/scopes and interpreter frames inside the existing HS stack. |
| `port/linux/game/mcc_objects.c` | MCC multiplayer vehicle placement masks. |
| `port/linux/game/mcc_grenades.c` | MCC slots 2/3, salted unit inventories, pickup/throw/drop behavior and HUD. |
| `port/linux/game/mcc_player.c` | MCC grenade selection/action checks and starting-profile counts. |
| `port/linux/game/mcc_network.c` | MCC host inventory and campaign-state messages over the existing distributed transport. |
| `port/linux/game/mcc_checkpoint.c` | MCC inventory/campaign snapshot inside proven-unused CPU save memory. |
| `port/linux/game/mcc_tag_validate.c` | Independent range/ownership state while applying stock tag schemas and their validators. |

Shared engine entry points have additive MCC dispatch for an MCC-namespaced
level or active MCC state. They route cache lifetime, raw resources, BSPs,
script extensions, validation callbacks, menu text and model palettes to
the new modules. For other levels those MCC checks do not select a loader.
The new code does not call the Custom Edition parser, converter, allocator,
script adapter, bitmap converter, sound encoder or behavior table. MCC
conversion writes only MCC-owned allocations, and unload releases them.

The pause builder appends its definitions and art to a copy of the live
tag index only after construction succeeds. It preserves the existing tag
records and restores the original index on unload. Its action IDs use the
separate `0x7000` range and require exact ownership of a generated widget;
an embedded map widget cannot acquire those permissions by copying an ID.
Allocation or graphics-resource failure releases the partial construction
without publishing it. Xbox and Custom Edition pause selection remains on
the existing route.

Maps with two through four grenade definitions are supported. The original
unit datum and player-action layouts are retained; the extra two counts
live in a separately owned table keyed by full salted unit handles.
Selection remains in the native unit fields. MCC profile, input, HUD,
pickup, throwing and inventory-network routes handle these slots.

MCC saves put the additional counts and campaign state into a 66,392-byte slot at the CPU
arena's end only if the allocator's current high-water mark leaves that
entire slot unused. No `game_state_malloc` call, pool capacity, native
allocation checksum or save-image size changes. Native checkpoint, core
and persistent writers already serialize the complete CPU/GPU arena;
the persistent image checksum therefore includes this snapshot. An MCC
footer adds version, canonical map identity, cache checksum and payload
CRC32. Before accepting the image, the adapter checks the payload and
remaps incoming object-header pointers to verify every salted unit record.
Unload restores the original unused bytes, including nonzero contents.
The version-2 payload includes gravity, navigation markers, dialogue gain
and the campaign's infinite-ammunition flag. Version-1 inventory snapshots
remain readable, with the new campaign state initialized to its baseline.
The footer remains at its original address. Images are validated before
restoring either state.

Campaign snapshots use the existing OpenCE host/client transport, authority
checks and stale-tick filtering. They are sent only in MCC games; the native
inventory and co-op message layouts are unchanged. Protocol version 27 is
required on every peer because this adds message type 84. Version 26 was
already used by the separately prepared OpenCE contribution branch.
This is an additional message in OpenCE's protocol, not an MCC networking
stack or compatibility with the retail MCC client. Client cheat restrictions
remain in force; only the host decides ammunition consumption.

This is an independently written implementation of documented wire formats,
informed by reading the existing engine's public interfaces and schemas.
No Custom Edition implementation was copied or renamed. Generic engine
operations, including vertex compression and GPU buffer construction, are
shared. MCC compiles a private namespaced instance of the unchanged generic
`stb_vorbis` library to decode Ogg; Xbox/CE retain their existing instance. The
MIT-licensed `port/third_party/bcdec` dependency decodes BC7 and DXT blocks;
its accompanying license and provenance are retained. This statement does
not claim the legal two-team meaning of formal clean-room reverse
engineering.

## Wire format and conversions

The reader admits little-endian `head`/`foot` caches with version 13 and
singleplayer or multiplayer scenario type. Tag memory uses the base
inferred from the tag-array pointer minus the 40-byte MCC tag header.
Each index entry is 32 bytes. Linked pointers are checked against the
loaded data before access. File and multiplication ranges use subtraction
or wider arithmetic to avoid wrapping.

Models use the MCC `mod2` part layout and uncompressed 68-byte vertices.
The adapter creates new 104-byte Xbox part descriptors, compresses vertices
to 32 bytes and uploads the index strips. Local node indices are mapped to
global nodes when possible; models requiring more engine palette slots
use an MCC-owned palette per part. No CE palette storage is consulted.

Version-13 BSP vertex data is external to the BSP tag allocation but can be
embedded in the same map file. The adapter follows the BSP header's vertex
byte count and file offset, reads the material's 56-byte environment and
20-byte lightmap streams, and compresses them into adjacent 32-byte and
8-byte streams. The converted streams have a separate tracked lifetime;
BSP changes release only the previous BSP's buffers.

Bitmap conversion supports the common Halo pixel formats, including P8,
DXT1/3/5 and MCC's BC7 format 18. BC7 is decoded to ARGB8888 for the existing
renderer. Pixel rows, Morton ordering and cube/mip layout are packed by
the independent MCC adapter. The MCC environment bitmap flag is metadata, so it is cleared
when constructing the Xbox descriptor. Compressed and palette flags are
derived from the resulting format. Model flag `0x40` and HUD meter flag
`0x20` identify resources already in Xbox channel order. Those channels
are preserved; references with the flags clear receive Gearbox-to-Xbox
channel conversion. A bitmap used by consumers
that require different channel layouts gets separate MCC-owned tag and
pixel copies, with the relevant consumer's reference redirected. The tag
index can grow into a separate checked allocation for those copies.

MCC HUD placements use a 960p canvas, converted to the native 480p canvas
in MCC-owned tags. Bitmap half-scale flags are a separate factor, so high
resolution images retain their original texels. Anchors, number advances,
waypoint/damage margins and direct icon geometry are normalized; the
motion-sensor radius and font-relative icon offsets/advances already use
native units and are retained. Five native
HUD/UI files contain additive dispatch only: every pre-existing statement
is retained. Xbox/CE dispatch is neutral before any bitmap lookup or draw.
The pause A/B glyphs and pickup icons use their own bitmap flags, with
matching cursor advances so text remains beside the correctly sized icons.
Pause glyphs align to the active UI font's capitals instead of inheriting
a map's custom HUD icon baseline.

MCC textures bind their immutable converted allocations directly through an
MCC-owned hardware-header registry. Exact registered header identity grants
access to the pixels; a copied descriptor or arbitrary physical-address word
does not. GPU textures upload lazily and remain owned until MCC unload,
which unbinds and deletes them before freeing their source pixels. This
avoids another pixel copy and allocation in the Xbox/CE texture staging
cache, whose capacity and policy remain unchanged. BC7 decoding retains
the full decoded texels; there is no additional lossy recompression or
resolution reduction. Host memory and GPU texture capacity still bound
the maps the machine can render. The same owned pixels remain available
to CPU object-lighting samples. Two-dimensional DXT resources preserve
their complete 2-by-2 and 1-by-1 source mip blocks for those samples, while
the GPU descriptor retains its native mip limit. Unload clears only CPU
base pointers that still name the MCC-owned allocation.

The audio adapter accepts embedded or externally indexed PCM16, Xbox ADPCM and Ogg Vorbis
permutations. It uses independent bounds checks and codec state. Mono
output uses the game's 22,050 Hz format; stereo output follows the admitted
22,050/44,100 Hz tag rate. Necessary conversions produce an MCC-only ADPCM
stream. Unsupported or damaged audio rejects the map instead of silently
removing sound.
External ADPCM that already matches the native sample rate is validated
and retained byte-for-byte. The independent resource reader checks the
16-byte resource header, bounded names/index tables, resource type and
payload ranges. Sound names identify the tag, pitch range and permutation;
bitmap names identify the tag and image. Indexed whole-tag replacements
are still unsupported.

Compiled script function and engine-global indices are linked by the
names retained in the script strings. The adapter provides
`objects_distance_to_object` and `mcc_mission_segment`, and maps
`player_effect_set_max_vibrate` to the engine's rumble operation.
Other unresolved names reject the map. `mcc_mission_segment` evaluates its
string argument normally, records a bounded local diagnostic event and
returns true for a supplied string. This acknowledges the event locally;
it does not implement the MCC telemetry service. The boolean result retains
the conditional `sleep` calls used in shipped and Ruby campaign scripts.
It does not call `core_save_name`: that Xbox function writes a raw debug
save, and remains unchanged and unavailable to map scripts.

Additional MCC campaign operations include `local_players`,
`game_is_authoritative`, `objects_distance_to_position`, `sleep_forever`
(current or named script), gravity setting/reset and breadcrumb navigation
at positions, flags or objects. Local players excludes remote and dead
units. Sleep uses the existing interpreter stack and native wake semantics.
Navigation has eight independently owned team markers and uses the native
HUD drawing services; the host replicates the complete marker state and
gravity periodically, including after changes and late joins.

The two recognized `debug_ice_cream_flavor_status_*` globals for IWHBYD and
Grunt Birthday Party are read-only false values. This does not implement
skull gameplay, and scripts trying to set them are refused. MCC maps may
set `sound_gain_under_dialog` and `cheat_infinite_ammo`; the adapter captures
their previous values and restores them on unload. The native global table
and Xbox/CE write permissions remain unchanged.
Compiled MCC static/stub scripts support up to 16 typed parameters.
Signatures, scoped local references and call arguments are checked before
loading. The MCC interpreter extension keeps arguments, mutable local
values and the evaluation cursor in the existing thread stack; object-list
references survive sleeps and release on return or thread termination.
Nested and recursive calls retain separate scopes. The existing 512-byte
stack remains the recursion/depth bound. Dynamic console calls with
parameters are not supported by this extension; the cached map's calls
are the supported path. MCC syntax now retains its full 32,767-slot arena,
including unused slots for dynamic console expressions. This is the Halo 1
MCC format's signed 16-bit capacity, not 65,535. MCC's independent validator
checks the complete node span, occupied count, salted references and cycles
before the interpreter follows links. Its traversal and parameter workspaces
cover the full arena. Three additive dispatches in `hs.c` select MCC's
validation/allocation-admission path; Xbox and Custom Edition keep their
original 19,001-slot constants, validation storage and statements.
Syntax remains in MCC-owned tag memory, with unchanged datum handles and
thread/checkpoint layouts. No shared data-array structure or allocator changes.
The MCC tag walker also retains the full syntax byte span during its later
schema pass; the shared Xbox/CE schema still specifies 19,001 slots.

Ruby's Rebalanced was audited across all ten campaign maps: each reserves
32,767 slots. `a10` has a high-water count of 19,723, including 18,480 occupied
nodes; the other nine high-water counts are below 19,001. Its existing holes
are retained rather than compacting or renumbering the graph. Across these
maps, the only unsupported native name was `mcc_mission_segment` (225 calls,
42 in boolean contexts and 183 with a discarded return value).

Native Ruby loading exposed two additional MCC bitmap layouts. RGB565
lightmaps with flags `0x1281` are normalized only when their owning group is
a lightmap, they have no mipmaps, and the pixel range is complete and tightly
packed. Bit 12's broader meaning is not inferred. The existing descriptor
verifier still checks the normalized result. Four maps also contain a Wraith
HUD DXT1 texture whose tiny mip tail is sized using unrounded pixel counts.
For that exact full-chain size pattern, the converter retains every complete
mip level and logs the omitted tail; it never reads beyond the declared range.
Arbitrary truncation, missing base images and other unknown flags still fail.

Ruby's `sound\\music\\spooky1\\in` (including `b30` tag #3583) uses an
empty residue vector codebook. The generic decoder aborted the rest of the
residue after encountering it, producing an error and incorrect PCM. MCC's
private decoder normalizes only empty additive residue vector references
before the first overlap packet, matching Xiph's zero-contribution behavior.
Empty scalar floor/classification books are not covered by that rule.
Ogg checksums, page continuity, EOS, sample count and remaining decoder errors
are still checked. Decoder buffers return to their own allocator, independently
of the game's debug allocator and the later ADPCM format conversion.

An independent PCM comparison across all ten Ruby maps covered 50,186 Vorbis
references and 8,325 distinct streams: all decoded successfully and every
sample differed from libsndfile/libvorbis by at most one signed-16-bit unit.
These codec checks do not establish a complete campaign playthrough.

Solar Flare and Spasm Playground also use valid final Vorbis granule trims
across long/short window transitions. MCC decoding retains the requested
PCM frames while validating the remaining packets and a bounded overlap
tail. Page checksums, sequence, monotonic granules and decoder errors are
still checked. A comparison of 247 permutations from the two reported
sound tags matched libsndfile/libvorbis within one signed-16-bit unit.

Combat Revolved's material-less model part retains the native renderer's
skip behavior. Its 8192-pixel credits strip uses the MCC texture route;
the legacy texture cache's size policy is unchanged. Each bitmap tag has
its own virtual stream with exact tag-handle checks, allowing the total
decoded texture storage to exceed the former single 512 MiB offset range.

## Current boundaries

- Modern uncompressed version-13 maps are the target. Earlier Anniversary
  chunk-compressed caches, Halo 2 or later MCC maps and external indexed tags
  are not supported. Indexed MCC bitmap/sound payload resources are supported
  when matching files are installed as described above.
- The portable inspector accepts files up to `INT32_MAX`; runtime raw files
  must be smaller than `0x50000000` bytes because higher offsets identify
  MCC virtual resources. Runtime tag windows must be free, 64 KiB-aligned,
  64 MiB allocations based between `0x42000000` and `0x70000000` inclusive.
  The observed MCC base is `0x50000000`.
- There are at most 65,535 tags and 32 BSP references. Runtime conversion
  descriptors must fit below the lowest BSP in the tag window. Geometry
  currently admits at most 64 nodes per model, 22 palette nodes per part,
  256 geometries per model and 128 parts per geometry. Each part's vertex
  and triangle counts must be nonzero and at most 65,535.
- Non-volume bitmap dimensions are limited to 8,192 by 8,192 with depth one;
  volumes are limited to 512 by 512 by 256. There are at most 13
  mip levels after the base level. Individual raw/decoded allocations are
  capped at 128 MiB; aggregate normalized bitmap storage is capped at 1 GiB,
  with each tag's virtual stream smaller than 512 MiB. Actual allocation and
  GPU texture-size support remain required, especially on mobile devices.
  Linear textures must be two-dimensional, unmipped and uncompressed.
  Audio permutations are capped at 64 MiB of input and 16,777,216 decoded
  frames, with at most 256 MiB of converted audio.
- Reusing stock schemas and gameplay/render systems does not implement
  every MCC engine extension. MCC-only object behaviors, new shader
  semantics and UI callbacks require separate
  semantic work and representative maps. Embedded MCC widget event bytes
  are preserved: compatible callback IDs use the existing engine functions,
  while identified MCC-specific actions dispatch through the MCC adapter.
  This remains relevant to script-opened custom interfaces; the default
  pause menus use the separately generated definitions above. Unsupported
  embedded callbacks fail without performing the event's close/open actions.
  Native Settings is available only in MCC multiplayer with
  `display.menus=pc` and one local player.
  HUD placement normalization and overlay handling
  still require visual comparison against the map's intended appearance.
- No claim is made here of complete campaign/gameplay fidelity or
  synchronization under all conditions, performance parity, or tested
  Android/Linux runtime behavior. See the bounded test status below.

## Validation status

The supplied `MercuryRising/halo1/maps/a10.map` was inspected without adding
its proprietary contents to the repository. Its observed inventory is:

| Field | Observed value |
| --- | --- |
| File size | 407,040,369 bytes |
| Internal name / build | `mercury_falling` / `01.06.66.HELL` |
| Version / scenario type / flags | 13 / 0 (singleplayer) / `0x0007` |
| Tag base / bytes / count | `0x50000000` / `0x012D661C` / 4,575 |
| Models / model parts | 153 / 842 |
| BSPs / BSP materials | 1 / 263 |
| Bitmap records / BC7 records | 1,122 / 38 |
| Sound permutations | 6,629, all embedded |
| Scripts / globals / parameterized scripts | 54 / 12 / 0 |
| Reserved syntax slots / active high-water count | 32,767 / 2,697 |

The parser suite passes 17 tests including this fixture. The native
geometry harness passes ten tests, including conversion of the fixture's
models and BSP, malformed vertex ranges/indices/nodes/normals, and partial
GPU allocation failure cleanup and local/global 64-node palettes. The harness uses the real engine vertex
compressor and mocked GPU buffers; it verifies that no buffers remain after
disposal. This establishes conversion and ownership behavior, not visual
correctness. Thirteen media tests pass for independent Xbox ADPCM decoding,
mono/stereo encoding and resampling, BC7 known-color decoding, DXT edge
clipping, channel transforms, independent bitmap-tag copies, HUD scaling,
Morton/cube/mip packing, row padding and MCC multiplayer text normalization,
virtual sound-stream bounds, exact owned pixel access above the legacy
texture-cache budget, and complete tiny DXT mip chains sampled using the
actual native CPU address function. Seven additional texture-bridge tests compile the
actual bridge and native descriptor/size routines with a mocked GPU. They
cover exact identity, copied-header rejection, upload failure/retry,
unload/re-registration, P8 palette changes, 2D/linear/cube/volume descriptors,
and repeated frames binding thirteen 2K ARGB mip chains (290,805,632 bytes)
without pixel staging allocations or repeated uploads. Live Mercury
audio conversion processed 4,676 permutations into 103,256,532 ADPCM bytes;
this is a conversion-stage result, not a listening test. Its bitmap stage
converts 1,268 original/copied resources into 522,484,864 bytes. The native
MCC schema validator has 30 passing tests. Thirty catalog/path tests cover
the real catalog and runtime admission routines, including same-name maps
in all three namespaces, version/scenario filters, rescan, case handling,
catalog capacity, filename limits, traversal rejection, scenario-type
filtering with stable identities (including empty lists) and checkpoint
identity allocation/failure. Nine checkpoint menu tests verify separate
MCC, Xbox and CE routes, mixed save lists, missing-map handling and bounded
difficulty values.
Twenty-one save-image tests cover the actual MCC snapshot module and
native save entry points, including checkpoint/core round trips, stock
bypass, high-water collisions, original-byte restoration, corruption,
map/checksum mismatch and prospective unit salt/type/pointer checks.
Twenty-five generated parameter tests cover wire bounds, local scope,
call signatures, pre-publication AI casts, mutable values, nested/recursive
argument lookup, object-list ownership, disabled scripts, stack overflow
and serialized frame resumption. Neither supplied real map uses parameters;
the parameter extension's runtime evidence is from the generated harness.
Three lifecycle tests exercise the actual scenario-load, BSP-switch and
main-menu recovery functions. They check balanced time/collision state,
nonmodal initial MCC rejection, preserved inactive Xbox/CE dispatch and
later-BSP rollback, released MCC ownership, and UI recovery before any
failed-map gameplay initialization.

Twenty-nine UI tests compile the actual widget event dispatcher and MCC
callback adapter. They cover mouse/controller confirmation, checkpoint
revert/save, restart permissions, campaign/multiplayer/cooperative quit,
red/blue team choice and balance feedback, New Game routing, trusted native
Settings, unsupported events and isolation of non-MCC widgets. Generated
actions also check exact widget ownership, stale or copied handles,
multiplayer-only Settings and canonical map-name admission. Controller-local
closing tests retain another player's active menu, dispose the initiating
player's navigation history, and leave rejected team requests open. The
team-ingress tests exercise the actual server settings handler and MCC
adapter, including malformed lengths, wrong packet type, unjoined or wrong
machines, altered identity fields, live-player matching, campaign rejection,
balance rules and unchanged pregame/stock dispatch. These are action-routing
tests; they do not by themselves establish that every custom menu renders
or navigates correctly. The New Game lifetime
case synchronously frees the active menu and checks that event dispatch

The generated-pause suites and UI action suite pass 63 focused tests:
fifteen builder, twelve runtime and thirty-six action tests. They compile the real
builder and runtime with native tag/bitmap structures and a mocked graphics
backend. Coverage includes all 256 selection contexts, 24 root layouts,
viewport bounds, objective callback 18, UTF-16 strings, Cancel-first
confirmations, mode-specific actions and Settings visibility. The actual
native text-wrapping helper and MCC renderer hook are checked with variable
font metrics, width boundaries, existing line breaks, clipping and ownership
isolation. Guarded heap
checks and injected allocation/art/graphics failures verify cleanup,
deduplication, atomic publication, preservation of the original tag table,
and restoration on unload. The combined MCC and existing cache-format suite
passes 462 tests with four optional-fixture skips on the Windows x86
toolchain, with the supplied Mercury fixture enabled.

Native validation of the generated Mercury campaign menu confirmed the
shortened stock labels, complete wrapped objective, separated panels and
A/B footer. Revert produced the saved-game restore log, Restart returned
to the level's beginning after the loading transition, and Save and Quit
returned to `ui.map`. In Nitra multiplayer, Settings opened the native
player Settings screen and Cancel returned to the pause menu; choosing
Blue produced a team-1 log and respawn; End Game reached the postgame
carnage report. Restart returned through the three-second lobby countdown
and reloaded Nitra; Leave Game returned to the main menu. Nineteen focused
restart tests cover the delayed host UI callback, retained settings,
one-shot ownership, stale/disposed sessions and unchanged ordinary postgame
behavior. These are bounded interaction checks; extended network and
split-screen playtesting remains useful.

After the Settings ownership correction, a further native Nitra check
opened the correct profile, returned through Cancel and Escape, reopened
Settings successfully, and used OK with no changes to return to the pause
menu. Seven additional action tests cover controller identity, overlapping
editors, cleanup, failed opens and replacement-editor ownership.

The footer's native A/B glyphs were visually checked in Mercury singleplayer,
Nitra multiplayer, and both host and client menus in a two-process Mercury
co-op session. The glyph fix changes only the MCC-owned label and alignment;
the existing icon renderer is unchanged. All 27 pause builder/runtime tests
passed after the correction.

A two-process local network co-op check displayed the same campaign layout
on both machines, with only Resume and Leave on the client. The host's
Revert restored the saved game and logged the co-op rewind. Restart carried
both players through the lobby and reloaded Mercury's opening cinematic on
both machines. The client then left to the main menu while the host kept
playing; the host's Leave Game also returned to the main menu. Both test
processes exited normally. These checks exercise the real renderer and
transport, but do not substitute for extended Internet or multi-controller
playtesting.

Deferred team-change deaths have their own records keyed by full player and
unit handles. Only the matching no-statistics death receives neutral kill
attribution before network replication; this preserves native respawn and
objective cleanup without a Slayer suicide penalty. Tests include ordinary
deaths, recycled handles, client authority and unloading the map.

The reported red/green Mercury cliff bands match the native allocation
failure texture: `DEFAULT_BITMAP_PIXEL0/1` are transparent red and opaque
green. The captured `stabbed.txt` identifies the 2K cliff normal map as a
failed 22,369,664-byte allocation. Its source is a 5,592,432-byte BC7 mip
chain, expanded to ARGB for the native renderer. About 189 MiB of the
256 MiB staging cache was locked in that frame; its largest available
contiguous span was only about 11 MiB. Repeated retries explain the
associated stalls. The direct MCC binding above removes this staging
constraint. The reported black cliff faces are consistent with a failed
bump/lightmap sample, but the screenshots alone do not prove their cause.
A bounded native comparison rendered twelve camera angles at the captured
failure location. Both builds showed normal cliff textures in that fresh
run: the intermittent baseline failure was not reproduced, so those frames
are a regression check rather than a before/after reproduction. The fixed
Debug renderer also completed Mercury -> Xbox UI -> Xbox A10 -> Nitra ->
Mercury -> Xbox UI in one process without assertions, texture allocation
failures or stale-resource errors. The later generated-pause interaction
checks are described above; broader multiplayer and cooperative playtesting
remains necessary.

An independent script audit compared 748 live function calls, using 103
distinct function names, against the Xbox definitions. It found no
parameter-type drift for functions present in both. The only missing
Xbox names were the four vibrate-alias calls and six
`objects_distance_to_object` calls addressed above. Eight nonuniform
uncompressed cubemaps in the fixture confirmed mip-major storage (all six
faces within each mip): lower mip pixels matched upper mip averages to
less than 0.26/255 mean RGB error. Face-major interpretation produced
37–80/255 error. BC7 follows the same layout in the adapter; that particular
layout comparison did not independently test BC7.

The second supplied fixture, `Nitra v2/dangercanyon.map`, also passes the
parser and geometry harness. It is a 102,888,276-byte multiplayer cache,
internally `nitra_v2` with build `01.03.43.0000`. It has 2,353 tags occupying
5,911,224 bytes at `0x50000000`, 55 models, one BSP with 139 materials, 731
bitmap records (no BC7), and 992 embedded sound permutations. Its 11 scripts
and four globals have no parameters. There are 244 high-water syntax slots,
173 live nodes and 56 function calls using 21 distinct names. The only name
missing from Xbox is the vibrate alias (four calls); no parameter-type
drift or missing engine globals were found. Geometry produces 1,112 buffers
and releases all of them.

Live Mercury loading now reaches the rendered world and runs its scripts
after passing media, tag and BSP validation. The validator corrects one
genuinely empty one-frame animation in
`vehicles\falcon_destroyed\left_wing\one frame empty`: both default-pose and
frame payloads are absent, so its node count becomes zero. This is not a
conversion that discards a present animation payload. A two-process Nitra
test ran 1,020 ticks and accepted ten remote hits with no rejected hits.
That run exposed a NULL-free assertion during geometry teardown; all
nullable geometry cleanup paths were guarded, and the harness now rejects
NULL frees like the native debug allocator. The corrected build subsequently
completed an MCC-to-Xbox-to-CE-to-MCC transition in one process without
rejection or assertions. Mercury save, revert and core reload accepted a
snapshot containing four nonzero extra grenade inventories. A two-process
Mercury cooperative run lasted about 1,320 ticks, ran opening scripts and
cinematics, and spawned both players alive at matching positions. Its host
core contained eight extra grenade records; the client's save request was
refused as host-authoritative. A final cooperative run lasted about 1,350
ticks and found the same eight nonzero type-2/type-3 inventories on host
and client, including exact salted handles, at 40, 50 and 60 seconds.
Both processes shut down cleanly and the client returned to the Xbox menu.

A read-only source fixture was copied into ignored test data and its first
BSP vertex was changed to NaN. The native loader explicitly rejected that
copy, released MCC state and returned to the Xbox UI. The same process then
loaded Xbox `a10` and valid MCC Nitra, executed post-load console markers,
initialized rendering and exited successfully without assertions.

Native keyboard/mouse navigation also verified the MCC menu routes and
campaign/multiplayer descriptions. A10 proceeded through difficulty
selection into rendered Mercury gameplay;
Dangercanyon proceeded through Slayer, server setup and the LAN lobby into
rendered Nitra multiplayer gameplay. These bounded checks do not establish
a complete campaign playthrough. Separate
15-second native regression runs loaded Xbox `a10` and Custom Edition
`hugeass` into gameplay/BSPs without assertions. The existing `hugeass`
capacity warning was also present in a prior log; these short checks are
not exhaustive playthroughs.

The initial combined MCC and existing cache-format suite passed 298 tests
with six optional-fixture skips, including the BSP lifecycle and score-hint
checks, both locally and in Windows CI. The Linux MCC CI subset passed
252 tests with five optional-fixture skips. The final native Windows build
and a further rendered Nitra load also passed.

The original Linux regression suite requires POSIX interfaces and could
not run fully on the local Windows/MSVC toolchain. GitHub CI subsequently
built Linux Debug and Release and ran that suite successfully: 236 tests
passed, four skipped, and the separate light-storage checks passed.
Windows Debug, Release and light-storage CI checks also passed, as did
Android Debug and Release. The [complete build run](https://github.com/chestahh/GulchCE/actions/runs/37975964199)
and [MCC validation run](https://github.com/chestahh/GulchCE/actions/runs/37975964090)
cover implementation commit `a196ae0c`. These build/test results do not
establish Linux or Android gameplay behavior.

The subsequent menu split passed 68 focused catalog, menu and saved-game
tests and a native Windows build. The tests cover header-based classification,
empty categories, both spinner directions, solo and host launch paths,
local multiplayer's singleplayer exclusion, returning from difficulty
selection, and switching categories without retaining stale selections.

### Solar Flare, Spasm and Combat Revolved compatibility checks

The October 10 compatibility changes were checked against all 16 supplied
maps: Solar Flare `m0` through `m3`, Spasm Playground, and Combat Revolved
`a10`, `a30`, `a50`, `b30`, `b40`, `c10`, `c20`, `c40`, `d20`, `d40` and
`credits`. Each passed a bounded native Windows x86 load with rendering
and opening scripts enabled. Combat Revolved used its matching external
`sounds.map` and `bitmaps.map`; source assets remained read-only and were
not added to the repository. These are initial-load checks, not complete
campaign playthroughs or automatic level-progression tests.

The production Vorbis decoder was compared with libvorbis through
libsndfile for all 158 permutations in Solar Flare's reported sound tag
and all 89 in Spasm's. All decoded, with a maximum difference of one
signed 16-bit PCM unit. Generated tests also cover legitimate granule
trimming, long/short block transitions, damaged granules, CRC errors and
truncated input; accepting these valid streams does not disable integrity
checks.

A single native process loaded Solar Flare, saved changed gravity,
dialogue gain, infinite-ammunition state and a breadcrumb marker, changed
them again, and restored the saved state through both checkpoint revert
and core load. Read-only inspection of that test process confirmed the
restored MCC snapshot and live gravity/gain values. The same process then
loaded Xbox `a10`, CE `hugeass`, and Solar Flare again. MCC state was cleared
on the legacy maps, their original gravity/gain restored, and the MCC-only
functions were unavailable there. The process exited normally.

A bounded two-process cooperative run used the existing host/join path
and confirmed equal gravity, dialogue gain and breadcrumb state on host
and client after host changes, followed by a synchronized gravity reset.
Both exited normally. This tests the new state message on loopback; it
does not establish Internet reliability, every campaign's co-op behavior,
or a full campaign playthrough.

The combined MCC, existing cache-format and BMP suite passed 738 tests,
with six optional-fixture skips. The Windows x86 release build passed.
Linux and Android builds of these
particular changes have not been verified locally; the Windows build
configuration did not provide an Android target. Earlier CI results
above apply to their named commits, not these changes.

Set `MCC_TEST_MAP` to an existing map path to opt into the real-fixture
checks. The parser tests are portable; the geometry harness currently
requires the x86 Windows game headers/toolchain and skips elsewhere.
`port/tools/mcc_cache_report.c` builds with `mcc_cache_format.c` and only
the C standard library, so files can also be audited outside the game.
None of these commands downloads or bundles a game map.
